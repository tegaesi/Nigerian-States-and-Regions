# Nigerian-States-and-Regions
This notebook analyses a dataset scrapped from Wikipedia on Nigerian Population by State. The figures are based on the 2006 Nigerian population census. This means they are over a decade old, and thus, not representative of the current Nigerian population. Nonetheless, the rankings of regions and states are expected to still reflect the current reality.
